# 2-3: What are neurons, and how do they transmit information?

**Neuron** : _A nerve cell that carries electrical impulses. Neurons are the basic units of our nervous system._

**Dendrites** : _The branches of neurons that receive signals from other neurons. The signals go into the cell body (or soma)._

**Axon**: _The axon is the part of a neuron that sends the signal to the synapse. Axons are long, thin and tendril-like. Axons are much like a highly developed dendrite._

**Myelin sheath**: _The insulating envelope of myelin that surrounds the core of a nerve fiber or axon and facilitates the transmission of nerve impulses._

**Action potential**: _Occurs when the membrane potential of a specific cell location rapidly rises and falls_

**Threshold**: _the critical level to which a membrane potential must be depolarized to initiate an action potential._

# 2-4: How do nerve cells communicate with other nerve cells?

**Synapse**: _A structure that permits a neuron (or nerve cell) to pass an electrical or chemical signal to another neuron or to the target effector cell._

**Neurotransmitters**: _Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers. They send information between neurons by crossing a synapse._

**Reuptake**: _The reabsorption of a neurotransmitter by a neurotransmitter transporter located along the plasma membrane of an axon terminal (i.e., the pre-synaptic neuron at a synapse) or glial cell after it has performed its function of transmitting a neural impulse._
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Reuptake_both.png/350px-Reuptake_both.png)

**Synaptic gap**: _The minute (my-noot) space between the cell membrane of an axon terminal and of the target cell with which it synapses_

**All-or-none response**: _In short the propagated impulse in a single fibre cannot be graded by grading the intensity or duration of the stimulus. The nerve fibre gives a maximum response or none at all._

# 2-5: How do neurotransmitters influence behavior and how do drugs and other chemicals affect neurotransmission?

**Neurotransmitter pathways** : _The Path that the Neurotransmitter takes_
![](https://media.sciencephoto.com/image/k0042065/800wm/K0042065-Neurotransmitter_pathways_in_the_brain.jpg)

**Acetylcholine**: _Functions as a neurotransmitter and as a neuromodulator. The brain contains a number of cholinergic areas, each with distinct functions; such as playing an important role in arousal, attention, memory and motivation._

**Dopamine**: _Plays important roles in executive functions, motor control, motivation, arousal, reinforcement, and reward, as well as lower-level functions including lactation, sexual gratification, and nausea. TYPE: Monoamine Neurotransmitter_

**Serotonin**: _Modulates mood, cognition, reward, learning, memory, and numerous physiological processes such as vomiting and vasoconstriction. TYPE: Monoamine Neurotransmitter_

**Norepinephrine**: _Increases arousal , alertness, enhances formation and retrieval of memory, focuses attention, and also increases restlessness and anxiety. TYPE: Monoamine Neurotransmitter_ 

**GABA (gamma-aminobutryic acid)**: _Reduces neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system._

**Glutamate**: _Used by every major excitatory function in the vertebrate brain_

**Endorphins**: _Inhibits the communication of pain signals_

**Agonists**: _A chemical that binds to a receptor and activates the receptor to produce a biological response_

**Antagonists**: _Blocks the action of the agonist_

# 2-6: What are the functions of the nervous system’s main divisions, and what are the three main types of functions?

**Nervous system**: *The nervous system derives its name from nerves, which are cylindrical bundles of fibers (the axons of neurons), that emanate from the brain and spinal cord, and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body*

**Central nervous system (CNS)**: *The part of the nervous system consisting primarily of the brain and spinal cord.*
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/1201_Overview_of_Nervous_System.jpg/663px-1201_Overview_of_Nervous_System.jpg)

**Peripheral nervous system (PNS)**: *Connects the central nervous system (CNS) to the limbs and organs.*

**Nerves**: *An enclosed, cable-like bundle of fibers (called axons) in the peripheral nervous system.*

**Sensory neurons**: *Neurons that convert a specific type of stimulus, via their receptors, into action potentials or graded potentials.*

**Motor neurons**: *A neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.*

**Interneurons**: *Neurons that connect two brain regions, i.e. not direct motor neurons or sensory neurons.*

**Somatic nervous system**: _Part of the peripheral nervous system associated with the **voluntary** control of body movements via skeletal muscles_

**Autonomic nervous system (ANS)**:
* A Division Of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
* Supplies smooth muscle and glands
* Influences the function of internal organs.
* Acts **largely unconsciously** and regulates bodily functions
* Regulates heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, pupillary response, urination, and more.
* The Primary Mechanism in control of the fight-or-flight response.

**Sympathetic nervous system**: *(Excitatory - Increases Energy during Interaction) The sympathetic nervous system leads to increased arousal*

**Parasympathetic nervous system**: *(Inhibitory - Decreases Energy after Interaction) The parasympathetic nervous system leads to decreased arousal*

**Reflex**: *An involuntary, unplanned sequence or action and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a stimulus*


# 2-7: How does the endocrine system transmit information and interact with the nervous system?

**Endocrine system**: *The endocrine system includes those organs of the body which produce hormones. It helps to regulate metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, and plays a part also in mood.*
![](https://theforceforhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bigstock-132285512.jpg)

**Hormones**: *Hormones are the chemical messengers of the endocrine system. Hormones are the signals which adjust the body's internal working, together with the nervous system.*

**Adrenal glands**: *The adrenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The adrenal gland makes hormones which control stress. It is involved in the production of steroid hormones. Among these hormones are cortisol and adrenaline.*

**Pituitary gland**: *The pituitary gland (or hypophysis) is an important part of the endocrine system. It is at the base of the brain between the eyes. The pituitary is attached to the hypothalamus, which is also a gland. The pituitary controls a whole range of vital functions by secreting hormones.*

**Hypothalamus**: *The hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger, thirst and circadian cycles. It is the control system which regulates the pituitary gland, the 'master gland' of the body. It is also involved in regulating seggs drive.*
