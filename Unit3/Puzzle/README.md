# Summary

I have designed a puzzle made out of the lobes of the brain for my AP Psychology class. I have included the following parts. Frontal Lobe, Parietal Lobe, Occipital Lobe, Temporal Lobe, Brain Stem, Cerebellum, Sensory Cortex, Motor Cortex, Brocaâ€™s Area, and Wernicke's Area. *A link to the files will be up shortly*

# How I Designed This

## Project: Brain Puzzle (By Lobe)

I designed this puzzle using a diagram from the "Psychology, 9th Edition" book written by David Myers.

## Project: Brain Puzzle (By Lobe)

Objectives:
The students would be able to learn the lobes of the brain by putting this puzzle together and justifying what each lobe is, the use of the lobe, and where it is located in relation to other parts of the brain. 

Audiences: Grades: 8-College; Age: 13+ 

Preparation: 
Students should have some prior knowledge of the anatomy of the brain and what it looks like. After printing each part, whether it is different colors as pictured above, or not. Make sure to keep all pieces together. It is irritating when one piece is misplaced, it looks incomplete without all the pieces.

Steps: 
As you are printing this puzzle make sure you lay out what colors you want each piece to be. (If you chose to do different colors for each part). 

Results: 
Make this puzzle your own, by changing up the colors and size. Learning should be fun, and this is the main point behind designing a puzzle to learn the major parts of the brain.
